### Plugin Record Suite
Mutagen offers custom classes, interfaces, and functionality for each Bethesda record type.  For example, if you want to deal with and modify Potions in a mod you can read/write using a `Potion` class which has members for every stat and field.  It comes with a suite of functionality alongside, such as how to print to string, how to compare equality, how to write itself, etc.

### Code is Generated
Records and their functionality are created and maintained via a code generation library.  As such, the records feel like they are hand written, without actually needing to write them by hand.  As new functionality is added or internal optimization is improved, most of Mutagen's code is regenerated to gain all the benefits without needing to manually update the definitions for every record that exists.

Most functionality and use case scenarios deal with these generated records in some way.  Learn more and explore the details in the other related pages.
